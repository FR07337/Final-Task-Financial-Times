1. One of the most reliable sources found for US domestic 'box office' revenue is the one provided by 'Box Office Mojo by IMDb Pro' (https://www.boxofficemojo.com/). This dataset provides a detailed breakdown of box office performance, including daily, weekend, weekly, and yearly performance as well as cites a diverse range of sources such as film studios, distributors and sales agents.
2. The 'Box Office Mojo' data can be liscended through the GraphQL-backed API which is available exclusively via AWS Data Exchange. There is a one-month free trial API of the complete IMDB dataset which includes IMDbPro's Box Office Mojo for which I requested access at the beginning of the week, however the service has not responded in time. Due to the time constraints of the projects, the data was obtained through web-scapping the tables available on the 'Box Office Mojo' website (as shown in the R code). Given the available data, I decided to produce two charts : a column-line timeline of the weekly gross US box office revenues (2018-2023) and a calendar heatmap of the numbers of available releases in US (2018-2023). Both charts show that there is a slow recovery of the US film industry after the cinema shutdown during the pandemic, however the industry numbers still do not match pre-pandemic levels. One thing to note is that the box office data does not take into account the rise in streaming platforms and digital releases which could have impacted the US film industry.
